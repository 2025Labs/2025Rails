		In addition to the above list, here are a few more camps we find noteworthy. In California, we like <a href="http://www.galileo-camps.com/" target="_blank">Camp Galileo</a>, which is a highly-regarded series of summer camps oriented around the ideas of innovation, invention, and creativity. They do offer financial aid for families that need it. They also have a partner camp with the <a href="http://summercamps.thetech.org/" target="_blank">Tech Museum of Innovation</a>.  The Tech partner camps (for rising 4th-8th graders) include topics such as circuits, video game design, programming, robotics, filmmaking, etc. <p><p>There are also virtual <a href="http://makezine.com/maker-camp/" target="_blank">Maker Camps on Google+</a> for teens put on by Make: magazine (founders of the Maker Faire event series). They seem to have fairly regular &#8220;camp&#8221; events, not just in the summer. Kids would need a Google+ profile to participate. As parents of younger kids, we confess to being uncomfortable with the idea of kids on social networking sites. However, you can participate with your kids (in which case, you could participate before they are teenagers). Or, it might be a good time to teach them about Internet safety anyways.<p><p>

			According to the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), African-American students comprise only about 4% of the Engineering undergraduate students, and the trend is showing no signs of improvement.
