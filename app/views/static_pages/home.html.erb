					<h5>Engineering, Computer Science, and Stereotypes &#8212 February 2015</h5>
				 Recent University of Washington research shows that inaccurate stereotypes are a key cause of gender disparity in both Engineering or Computer Science. Late last year, CEO Melissa Liu wrote a LinkedIn piece about stereotypes and how they affect the expectations of adults of kids in their lives, and the adults' encouragement (or lack thereof) towards engineering and programming activities.
