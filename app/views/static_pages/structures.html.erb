		<h5><a id="Technology Defined"><span class="sectionheader">Technology is the application of science to invent useful things or solve problems.</span></a></h5>
		Engineers use the different engineering processes to create and maintain technology. Over the next two sections we are going to take a closer look at two types of technology: structures and machines. We’ve included structures and machines as part of our framework, primarily because there are great resources available to play with and learn about them, and understanding what they are will take you a long way toward understanding much of the technology you come into contact with daily. First we’re going to start with a fuller definition of technology.
				<p><p>
				Merriam-Webster defines technology as "the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems." So technology is something that is both manmade and useful. Not everything manmade is technology. For example my son loves to draw cartoons, which are an absolutely manmade creation. They are wonderful drawings and stories, but they can’t rationally be described as either useful or problem solving. Rather the cartoons are entertainment and (I’m sure you would agree) art. 
				<p><p>
				So when we are referring to technology, we are talking about things that are useful and problem solving. Are there other limits to what can be defined as technology? Does it have to be tangible? Absolutely not. For example, take the computer program I am using to type. I can’t touch the software, but it’s manmade, useful, and solves a big problem for me (sloppy penmanship). As a concept, technology is very broad, even if we now tend to use the word technology to refer to the latest in computing or electronic gadgets. Technology comes in different forms, some of which are tangible (machines, devices, structures, etc.) and some of which aren’t (processes, programs, systems, etc.). 
				<p><p>
				Before moving onto structures specifically, let’s circle back to the concept of the “use of science” from the definition of technology. Do you actually have to know you are using science to create technology? Nope. People were creating wheels to move wagons long before scientists gave us a precise, mathematical explanation of how wheels reduce friction and therefore make it easier to move something.  Science is the study of the natural world through observation and experimentation. Through science we seek to understand the underlying principles of why things work the way they do, which explains why our ability to create technology grows as our knowledge of science has grown. Science and technology go hand in hand. With that brief introduction to technology, we turn to structures, the first of the two types of technology we'll explore in this intro to engineering.
				<p><p>
					
				<h5><a id="A Structure is Load Bearing"><span class="sectionheader">A structure is something that is load bearing</span></a></h5> 
				As you read this website, you are likely in a building, sitting in a chair of some sort, possibly with your computer on a table in front of you. That’s five bits of technology right in that one sentence – the building, chair, table, computer and website. We’ll get to computers and websites in the machines and computing sections, but the focus of this section is on things like buildings, chairs, and tables, which are structures. The word structure can refer to many things, from social structures to molecular structures. At its broadest definition, a structure is something with parts arranged in a particular way. From an engineering perspective, a structure is something that is load bearing, which means it either supports or resists a load or does both at the same time.
				<p><p>
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span6">
					Load is another word for force, and different structures are designed to hold up with different forces being exerted on them. For example a bridge is designed to support the weight of the vehicles and people crossing it and also to resist the force of the wind blowing against it. Depending on where the bridge is located, it might also be designed to resist the movement of the earth during an earthquake. A bridge or maybe a skyscraper may have been one of the first things you thought of when you  read the word structure. However, as mentioned above, structures also include items like tables and chairs, which have a lot fewer parts and have much less at stake if they fail.

				<h5><a id="Structures are under Tension, Compression or Both Forces"><span class="sectionheader">Structures are either under tension, compression, or both forces at the same time.</span></a></h5>
				A force is a push or pull on an object resulting from its interaction with another object.  When dealing with structures, a force that is a push creates compression. A force that is a pull creates tension. To understand these forces, let's use the chair you are sitting in as an example. Before you sat on it, the chair was already supporting a load, as the chair has to support its own weight without collapsing. This intrinsic weight of the structure is called the dead load. The chair is designed to bear both its dead load and the weight of your body, which in this example is the live load, or non-intrinsic weight. When you sat down in the chair, you exerted an additional force on the chair, a push generated by your weight (the gravitational force on your body) that put additional compression on the chair. Even though you can't see it, that legs of the chair actually get a little bit shorter under compression. When you stand up, the chair returns to its original height. 
				<p><p>
				Imagine instead that you are now sitting on a swing. Unlike the chair which is under compression, the swing is under tension, as its chains are being pulled. When you sit down on a swing, your weight adds additional tension, making the chains just a little bit longer. When you stand up, the chains return to their original length. At this point, you might be thinking that when you sat down on the swing you were still compressing the swing, and you would be correct. The swing is under both tension and compression once you sit on it. 
				<p><p>
					
				<h5><a id="Structures are Elastic"><span class="sectionheader">Structures stay up in part because they are able to bend, or deflect, under the forces acting on them and return to their original shape when the forces are removed, a behavior called elasticity</span></a></h5>
				
				We have to take a deeper dive into physics for a moment, specifically Newton's third law of motion, which tells us that for every force there must be an equal and opposite force. What on earth does that have to do with structures you ask? Well, it means that when you exert a force on your chair, swing, or any other structure, then it has to be exerting an equal and opposite force against you. Opposite does not mean a pull instead of a push, opposite has do with directions. So if you are exerting a force down, the chair has to be exerting an equal force up. If the chair wasn't exerting an equivalent force, you would crash through it. If it was exerting more force, you would fly off it.
				<p><p>
				At this point, you might be thinking, don't structures just stay up because they are built out of strong materials? No one would build a chair out of marshmallows and expect it to stand up like a chair made out of wood. That's true, but why we choose to build chairs out of wood instead of marshmallows and the answer to the question of how structures stand up are related. 
				<p><p>
				All structures can be understood as a combination of the strength and stiffness of their design and materials. Stiffness is a measure of a structure or material's elasticity, which is the ability to bend, or deflect, and then return to its original shape. As a material, wood has both more strength and stiffness than marshmallows, which makes it a better choice for this particular structure. When a material which has elastic behavior bends, it is exerting a force. This ability to deflect is what allow structures to exert the equal and opposite force which allows them to stay up. Because material selection is so critical to any piece of tangible technology, we have a separate section which gives more of an overview of history and properties of materials. 
				<p><p>
				To understand this concept better, let's go back to the chair example again. Imagine that each of the chair legs is a super stiff spring. When you push your hand down on a spring, you can feel it pushing back against your hand. That is exactly what the chair is doing; you just can't see it. The materials and design engineers choose for different structures will largely depend on the type and degrees of forces the structure has to withstand, and therefore the appropriate amount of stiffness and strength it must have.
				
				
				<h5><a id="Structures Have Different Parts"><span class="sectionheader">Structures have different parts such as columns, beams and arches</span></a></h5>	

				Thus far, we've spent a lot of time talking about chairs and swings, but the cool thing about structures is that regardless of the scale and the materials used, the individual elements are largely comparable from structure to structure. We're only going to discuss three elements - arches, columns and beams - because they allow us to show how structures have similar elements and also to show how the different elements can be used to solve specific structural challenges.  
				<p><p>
					
				<b>Arch</b> An arch is a structure that spans a distance in compression only. As mentioned above, the ability of a structure to stand depends on both the design and the materials used. In ancient times, most of the materials available, and the designs that were understood, relied on compressive strength. Compression means a push, so each stone or piece of concrete used in an arch pushes against the other pieces of the arch - nothing is ever pulling. Arches were widely used in ancient times, especially by the Ancient Romans. The strength of both the design of the arch and the materials the Romans used to build them is evident by the many that are still standing, some of which are in actual use.  [picture of an ancient arch here and a diagram of how an arch works.] 
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span4">
			
				<b>Column</b> A column provides vertical support to a structure, and is always under compression. Like an arch, columns need to be built with materials that have compressive strength. However, depending on the height of structure a column can also be under tension if it has horizontal force acting on it, like a skyscraper in the wind. Therefore, some structures need columns made of out materials that are strong in tension as well.

				</div>
				</div>
				<p><p>
				<b>Beam</b> A beam provides horizontal support to a structure, often connecting two columns. It is always under both compression and tension. We'll go back to the swing example to understand how beams work. When you sit on the seat of swing, especially if it is one of those thick rubber seats, you'll notice that the edges of the swing pull up to wrap under you. The top of the seat is under compression from your weight, and the bottom of the seat is under tension, as it is being pulled up while the top is being pushed down. A common material that you will see in construction is steel, because it is strong in both tension and compression, and it can be cost effectively manufactured.

				<h5><a id="Structures Change as New Materials and Designs are Created"><span class="sectionheader">Structures change as new materials and designs are created</span></a></h5>
				Many of the types of structures that are a core part of our every day lives have been around for millennia. There is nothing recent about people using tables, chairs, buildings, bridges, dams, and roads. What has changed over the years are the methods and materials with which we build structures.
				<p><p>
				For example the oldest, tallest structure in the world is the Great Pyramid of Giza, which was completed around 2560 BCE. It loomed over the ancient world at an impressive 481 feet (146.5 m), and was built of stone. The tallest structure in the world built before the industrial revolution was the Washington monument which was also made of stone just like the pyramids. Completed in 1884, it stands 555 feet (169 m) tall, representing a 15% gain in height in 4,444 years. The tallest building in the world today is the Burg Khalifa in Dubai. It was completed in 2009 and stands 2,722 feet (829.8 m); a 390% gain in height over the Washington Monument in just 125 years. The introduction of a cost-effective method for creating steel in 1855 by Henry Bessemer, among other inventions, allowed engineers to safely build to increasingly greater heights and longer spans.

				<h5><span class="sectionheader">Summary</span></h5>
				Technology is the application of science to invent useful things or solve problems. Structures are a type of technology and are designed to be load bearing. Load is another word for a force, which can either be a push or a pull on an object. A push creates compression and a pull creates tension. All structures are under compression, tension, or both forces at the same time. Structures and the materials with which they are made exert forces are able to bend under tension or compression, and return to their original shape and size when the force is removed, a behavior called elasticity. Very different structures share similar parts, and different parts can be used to solve specific engineering challenges. Finally, engineers are able to build different structures as new designs and materials are created.
				Making structures is something people start doing as toddlers, when we first learn to stack blocks (which you now know are under compression). In fact, how many blocks a young child can stack is used as an indication of healthy development. Once your child moves beyond blocks there are many great toys and resources for learning about how to build different structures, and building is an incredibly creative and inventive activity. Hopefully this section has given you a little more perspective on the different structures around us. Next we turn to materials, as the history of materials and the decision about what to make a structure out of is an inherent part of any piece of technology.
