		<h5><span class="sectionheader">There is no Engineering without Energy</span></h5>
		<p>In order to power the technology in our daily lives, we harness it from a variety of sources (fossil fuels, wind, etc.), move it to where we need it (think of the power lines you see everywhere), potentially store it for later use (like in a battery or as potential energy in a hydroelectric dam), and then consume it. This section covers each part of the energy life cycle, but first it's important to get an historical perspective on energy sources.
			<p><p>
			As we mentioned in the <a href="machines.html">machines</a> section, prior to the Industrial Revolution, people had access to only four sources of energy&#151;water, wind, people and animals&#151;to power their machines. They harnessed the power of running water in rivers by using water wheels to turn turbines to mill flour for bread. They harnessed the power of the wind using windmills. They used the power of people or animals to row boats, turn wheels, and lift heavy items. 
			<p><p>
			That all changed in 1781, when James Watt's steam engine ushered in the Industrial Revolution. New machines that were powered initially by burning coal and eventually other fossil fuels such as gas changed the face of the industrialized world. In 1880, Thomas Edison patented the first commercially viable lightbulb, marking the beginning of widespread use of electricity as a power source. It's important to note that these inventors weren't the only or even the first people working with steam and electricity. However, they were the first to produce viable  products using these power sources, which led their widespread adoption. By the 1920's, power companies started working together to create what we call the electricity grid: the power source for our lights, heat, air conditioning, televisions, microwave ovens, and the computer you are using to read this web page. <p><p>

	<h5><span class="sectionheader">There are a variety of <span class="shkeyword">Energy Sources</span> that can power our modern world</span></h5>
	
There are a variety of ways that we generate energy to fuel our modern world, many of which we've been using for hundreds or thousands of years. Some of these are considered renewable, like wind and sunlight, which means that we are not in danger of running out of them. Some of these are being consumed faster than they are being created, such as coal, which means that we will some day run out of that energy source. The sections below highlight some of the key sources of energy used to power our world.

	<b>Solar Power</b> uses the power of the sun's light to create electricity.  There are a few different ways that electricity can be converted from solar radiation. Currently, the most common method uses solar panels that consist of solar cells made from semiconductor materials, such as silicon. Solar cells are photoelectric, which means that when light shines on it, the cells generate an electric current. The generated electricity can then be consumed at the point of generation, such as a solar-powered house or devices like the Mars Rover. Alternatively, the energy generated can be transmitted to the electricity grid.

<b>Fossil Fuels: Coal, Petroleum, and Natural Gas</b>
Fossil Fuels take their name from the fact that they are formed from the decayed remains of plants and animals from millions of years ago that are buried in the ground. Because it takes millions of years to create them, we consume them much more rapidly than they are renewed, and they are therefore considered &#34;non-renewable&#34; sources of energy. However, they are renewing constantly &#151;  just not at anywhere near the rate they are consumed.

	We extract energy from fossil fuels by burning them &#151;  in coal plants, in car engines, etc. This burning creates pollution and contributes to global warming. In some cases, the mining or drilling process can also create great ecological damage. For example, the Deepwater Horizon (BP) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 discharged close to five million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, after spilling oil into the gulf for 87 days and causing immense damage to marine and coastal wildlife habitats. In 2011, Chevron and driller Transocean were responsible for  a spill off the coast of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, with 155,000 gallons of crude oil spilled into coastal waters. In addition, <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13355" target="_blank">research</a> is being conducted into earthquakes occurring near sites of natural gas extraction through the &#34;fracking&#34; (hydraulic fracturing) extraction process. Fracking involves drilling thousands of feet into the ground and blasting water and chemicals into the rock, in order to extract gas which may be trapped in shale rock. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently studying the effects of fracking, which could result in new regulations for oil and gas extraction.

<b>Hydroelectric Power</b>
Hydroelectric Power refers to making electricity from the power of water in motion. This power can be the result of water flowing over a man-made dam falling downward with force due to gravity. A very old-fashioned form of water as an energy source was the use of a water wheel on a river to power flour mills in pre-industrial times, going back even to the Middle Ages. Hydro Power is a renewable energy source, like solar power.

<b>Biomass / BioFuels</b>
Biofuels are energy sources produced from recently living organisms. These recently living organisms are referred to as &#34;biomass&#34;, and can include things like garbage, scrap wood, plants, yard waste, etc. Like fossil fuels, biofuels come from living organisms. Unlike fossil fuels, biofuels were living very recently &#151; think of the rotting banana peel in your garbage can, rather than a lump of coal that came from plants that were living on Earth millions of years ago. Corn and sugar cane can be used to make ethanol, which can be used either as a complete fuel or as a fuel additive for vehicles. Biodiesels are made from vegetable oils and animal fats, and they can also be used either as complete fuels or as additives. When either are used as additives, they also provide a side benefit of reducing harmful emissions (particulates, carbon monoxide, etc.).

<p><p><b>Wind Farms and Windmills</b>
The wind can also be used to generate electricity. The wind turns rotors on a windmill, which spins a shaft. The rotating shaft uses magnets to generate a current (a rotating magnetic field can induce a current through a process called electromagnetic induction). Windmills have been used for a very long time to harness the wind to, for example, grind wheat. Wind energy is a renewable source of energy.

Energy sourced from any of the above methods can be consumed in a few different ways. This energy usage could be at the same <i>place</i> as the generation (think of your solar panels providing the power for you to watch your television), or somewhere else (as in the energy harnessed from your solar panels when you are not home, so that the excess is contributed to the electric grid for use elsewhere). The consumption could be at the same <i>time</i> of generation (as when you hand-crank a radio to power its immediate use), or later (like when you fill your gas tank to power your car for the upcoming week).

In the case of a gas-powered car, gasoline is placed in a car&#39;s gas tank, and then used to power the vehicle and move it. The gas is stored in the tank until it is needed, and then it is burned to power the vehicle. (The car&#39;s battery provides an additional source of power and is key to starting the vehicle. Just ask anyone who has ever been stuck trying to start a car with a dead battery!)

In the case of the variety of different energy sources used to power our electric grid, those sources generate energy, which is then transmitted, stored, and distributed to people that need it. When you turn on your garbage disposal, you have no way of knowing the source of the energy (solar, wind, etc.) or the location that it was generated (coal plant in Pennsylvania, nuclear plant in California, wind farm in Nevada). You just know that you pay the power company to provide power to your home, so that you can use the energy when you need it, for lights, household appliances, electronics, recharging your electric car overnight, and so forth.

In the case of a house with solar panels, much of the time the solar panels can fully power the house. In fact, in times where the solar panels are collecting more power than needed to power the household, the excess is often provided to the electric grid (potentially without compensation to the household generating the power for the electric company). However, at times, there is not sufficient sunlight to fully power the home using the solar panels. In that case, the house will consume power from the electric grid (and the household will be charged for the energy consumption). So, in this case, the consumption is often at the same place as generation, and could be at the same time &#151; but not always.

<div class="span4">
We&#39;ve all seen power lines: they are used to move power from generation to distribution. The energy is moved to distribution substations, and then to consumers. How do we generate exactly the right amount of electricity to meet our energy needs? Or do we?

<p><p>Energy supply fluctuates. Solar power relies on sunlight, which varies based on weather and time of day. Wind power relies on, well, wind. Power plants occasionally have issues and need to be shut down. Somewhat less often, new plants come online, or old plants get retired.

	Energy demand varies as well. Energy consumption can change quite a bit based on time of day, time of year, weather, as well as normal variation independent of those factors. 
Businesses are often at peak demand during weekdays. Homes are often at peak demand in the late afternoon and early evening. We may turn on our air conditioners on very hot days, and our heat on very cold days.  We may use more household lighting when it gets dark earlier. When it is rainy or cold, our kids may want to stay indoors to play video games instead of going outside to play.
<p><p>
So, how do we make sure we supply enough energy at times of peak usage? What do we do at times of lower energy demand? 
There are some alternatives: 1) Not meet peak demand, resulting in power outages (blackouts) or reduced availability (brownouts); 2) Use peak power generators that are used to generate an additional amount of power during peak periods only; 3) Store the excess energy when we have more supply than demand. It turns out that we are not always perfect at matching supply with demand. When we have excess demand that we cannot meet, we ask folks to reduce their demand or else face power outages.

<h5><span class="sectionheader">Energy Conversion takes energy from one form to another (and sometimes back again)</span></h5>
Wind is a potential source of energy, as is water at the top of a hydroelectric dam. But we do not plug our toaster into the water in the dam; we convert energy from one form to another. Think also about a battery in a hand-held game console, like a Nintendo DS. We take batteries out of a package we bought from the store, put them in the device, and then, when we turn on the device, we can get <i>electric energy</i> for our device from the batteries. But how?
<p><p>We can use the force of water spilling over a hydroelectric dam to generate electricity. This conversion leverages the potential energy of gravity in the water at the top of the dam. If, at some point of time, the electric grid somehow has an excess supply of energy that is not currently demanded, did you know that that energy can be used to pump water to the top of a hydroelectric dam to store it for future use (as "potential energy")? Here are a few more examples of how we convert energy from one form to another:
<p>We can use a hand-crank to charge a battery for an all-weather hazard radio. In this case, we are using some mechanical energy as a source to convert to chemical potential energy.
<p>We can plug in our electric car into our house&#39;s electricity system, which uses the electric power delivered to our home to store energy as chemical potential energy in our car&#39;s battery. Of course, the electricity delivered from our home could have been generated by burning coal, so that the &#34;clean&#34; energy of our all-electric car may actually not be that clean.
<p>I can get on a stationary bike that generates electricity when I pedal, and I can plug in a television to it. (If we powered all of our televisions this way, it could go a long way to improve the health of modern American society!)
	
<p>When you convert from one type to another, there may be some energy lost to the surrounding environment. For example, when you burn something for energy, some energy may be dissipated as light and heat in the surrounding air, and that can no longer be captured. (Think of when you run your oven, and your kitchen gets hot. On a hot day, you'd rather heat your dinner <i>without</i> heating your kitchen as well!) That drives notions of "efficiency" of various methods and continual efforts to improve efficiency.
<br>
	<h5><span class="sectionheader">Summary</span></h5>
	
<p>Energy is fundamental to engineering. We get energy to power the technology in our world from both renewable and nonrenewable sources. Energy can be stored for future use. The electricity grid distributes energy from diverse original sources&#151;burning coal, nuclear power plants, hydroelectric dams, etc.&#151; to consumers as electricity. We don't always know the source of the energy we are using at the time we are using it, because we get our power from the electricity grid, which harnesses energy from many sources and converts energy from various forms to other forms in the process. Thus, in this section you've learned about how we get, store, and consume energy to power our technology. Add that to your knowledge of the processes engineers use to create and maintain technology and your understanding of machines as an example of technology, and you've pretty good overview of the engineering landscape from the industrial revolution until about the 1960s. In order to get current, you need to add <a href="computing.html">computing</a> to your knowledge base, which is where we turn next.
