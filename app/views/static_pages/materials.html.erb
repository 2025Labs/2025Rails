				<h5><a id="Mats1"><span class="sectionheader">Would you build a bridge out of particle board? Or make a basketball out of glass? </span></a></h5> 
					Particle board is a wood product made from leftover wood, such as wood chips or sawdust. It is used in places where a wood-like material is desired, but low cost is more important than strength: uses such as kitchen drawers or low-cost furniture. So, it probably not the best choice for a structure - like a bridge - that must hold the weight of lots of large vehicles. And a basketball made of glass would likely not survive the first bounce on the floor - and even if it did, it would not rebound nicely back into your hand to allow you to continue to dribble down the basketball court. <p><p>Clearly then, materials used to build things must be appropriate for how those things are to be <i>used</i>, and choice of materials is often part and parcel of the design process. This section is going to describe some basics about how Engineers think about materials.
					<p><p>

				<h5><a id="Mats2"><span class="sectionheader">Materials are so critical that eras in history have been named for materials in use during the period</span></a></h5> 
					People have been thinking about materials for a very long time. In fact, we have named key periods of history by materials in use at the time. For example, the "Stone Age" refers to the very early period of mankind when people learned to make and use stone tools. <p><p>
					
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span6">
					The Bronze Age came after the Stone Age. Somehow, mankind's early experimentation with copper showed that adding tin to copper results in a metal alloy that is harder and has a lower melting temperature. An alloy is a combination of metals, and the alloy of copper and tin is a material we call Bronze. The lower melting temperature meant that people could <i>cast</i> bronze into particular shapes. Bronze was used to make weapons, tools, decorative items like vases and jewelry, and structures. 
					</div>
					<div class="span6">
						<%= image_tag("pics/BohemianBronzeVase.JPG", :alt => "Bronze cup. Prehistoric Times of Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia, National Museum in Prague", :class => 'picpadding') %>
					</div>
				</div>
					
				<p><p>Early materials were quite dependent on what was available in each particular geographic area, which is why bronze came into usage predominantly where both copper and tin were present (although in the case of some areas, only copper was available locally, and tin was transported through early trade routes). 
					
				<p><p>Interestingly, copper and arsenic were discovered as an early bronze alloy, but discontinued as it was discovered that peopled died after working with arsenic. A Chalcolithic period, or "Copper Age" occurred briefly in some areas at the beginning of the Bronze Age, during which particular regions were working with Copper but had not yet discovered Bronze as an alloy. Copper is a very soft metal, and if found in its native form (by itself and not combined with other things in an ore), it can be shaped simply by hammering. 
					
					<p><p>After the Bronze Age came the Iron Age, where people learned out to work with iron and then learned to make steel from it by adding an amount of carbon to it. People had worked with meteoric iron (iron from meteorites, typically with iron, nickel, and potentially cobalt as elements in the alloy) from a very early time, as early as 4000 BC. Much later, people learned how to smelt iron from iron ores. Iron ores are iron-containing rocks and minerals, such as hematite, and smelting refers to processes for extracting a metal from an ore. Smelting iron from iron ore requires high temperatures in special furnaces with the addition of a carbon source,  like plant material or charcoal. People eventually figured out that iron with a small amount carbon becomes quite strong - and thus steel was created. However, through all these early discoveries, materials science was actually quite lacking in conceptual understanding. People had studied <i>what</i> results when materials are heated, hammered, alloyed with other elements, etc., but they did not understand <i>why</i> - such as why adding tin to copper, or carbon to iron, results in a sturdier material. Materials science has matured tremendously since.
					<p><p>
						
				<h5><a id="Mats3"><span class="sectionheader">Materials have <i>properties</i>, which describe how they can be expected to behave under different conditions</span></a></h5> 
				If you drop a champagne glass, it is likely to break, but if you drop a pencil, it usually won't. If you stretch a rubber band out a few inches, it will snap right back; if you try to stretch out a pencil a few inches, it will break instead of stretching and recovering. These types of <i>properties</i> have names. Properties are inherent to a material, but can be changed through heating, cooling,  hammering, or adding other things to it. One example of changing the properties in a material is the process for making steel by adding carbon to iron. Iron and steel are mostly the same in terms of the elements that compose it (steel is iron with typically less than 1% carbon), but have different properties; the same is true for copper and bronze.<p><p> 
				
				<h5><a id="Mats4"><span class="sectionheader">A property is something about the material that is true regardless of its size or shape. </span></a></h5> 
				For example, <i>Density</i> is the amount of mass per unit volume: the density of a small ice cube is the same as the density of a very large block of ice . A material's <i>Melting Point</i> is the temperature at which the material will melt; for example, 32&deg; F for ice, but 2600&deg; F for low carbon steel. The melting point of mercury is about -38&deg; F, which is why mercury is liquid at room temperature. <p><p>
				
				There is a property called <i>Yield Strength</i>, which is how much a material can yield - or stretch - without breaking. One that can stretch before it breaks is <i>ductile</i>; one that breaks right away is called <i>brittle</i>. Rubber and copper are ductile; glass is brittle. Copper is made into wiring because it is both ductile and conducts electricity - it has to be ductile to be made into copper wiring; otherwise it would just break when stretched out into thin wire (which would make for lousy circuits). And, the ductility of rubber is the reason that a rubber ball bounces - it deforms upon contact with the ground, and the reaction to snap back to a fully round shape is what creates the upward movement. That's why a ball will bounce higher off a hard surface, like concrete, than a soft surface, like carpet - a hard surface creates more deformity in the ball. Try that with a glass basketball! <p><p>
					
					
				<h5><a id="Mats5"><span class="sectionheader"><i>Strength</i> is different from stiffness, and refers to the amount of force or stress required to break something </span></a></h5> 
				In the bridge example above, the rubber bridge may not break - but that doesn't make it a good bridge! 
				
				<i>Stiffness</i> is a measure of the inherent elasticity of a material, independent of its shape (the flexibility of a particular object will depend on the inherent stiffness of the material as well as the shape of the object). For example, rubber has a very low measure of stiffness, while diamond has a very high measure of stiffness. We build bridges and buildings out of stiff materials. (If you think about it, building a rubber bridge over a fast-running river would likely result in cars floating down the river.). The stiffness property is also sometimes called the "Young's modulus" or simply, "E".<p><p>
				
				Let's look at some examples (from page 43 of	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691125481/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0691125481&linkCode=as2&tag=2025labs-20">The New Science of Strong Materials or Why You Don't Fall through the Floor</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=2025labs-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0691125481" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />):<p><p>

				<p><p>Specifically, <i>tensile strength</i> is the amount of stress needed to break a material by breaking all the bonds between the atoms along the line of fracture. Tensile strength means strength under tension. When we talk about materials, we talk about "tension" and "compression". To think about tension, think about taking a suspender, and pull on both ends to stretch it out. To think about compression, think about taking a hammer to a block of wood.
					
				<p><p>When a material stretches under tension, or compresses under a load, what we are really talking about is the atoms or molecules in the solid getting further apart, or closer together. And, what is "giving" in between the atoms to allow them to stretch or compress is the interatomic chemical bonds that hold the atoms together in a solid. <p><p>

				The picture above is a representation of the interatomic bonds under normal conditions (no load), under compression (being squished down), and under tension (being stretched out). <p><p> 
					
					<h5><a id="Mats6"><span class="sectionheader">Engineers use terms like <i>stress</i> or <i>strain</i> when talking about materials under load </span></a></h5>
					"Stress" is load per unit area, commonly expressed as pounds per square inch, or PSI. For example, if you put a construction vehicle on a small, one-lane bridge, the stress will be higher than if you put a small car, such as a Smart Car on the same bridge, since the weight of the construction vehicle is much greater than the Smart Car. (Technically, there is a size - or area - difference as well, but construction vehicles are made of industrial-strength materials and are higher <i>density</i>, as well as just heavier.) Similarly, the Smart Car will cause less stress to a bridge with a larger cross-section, since the weight of the car is applied over a greater area. 
					<p><p>"Strain" is the amount of stretch under load per unit length. For example, a 100-inch metal rod which stretches one inch under load is <i>strained</i> by 1/100, or 1%. A 3-inch rubber band stretched under load by 1.5 inches is strained by 50%.<p><p>	
					
					
					<h5><a id="Mats7"><span class="sectionheader">Engineers also talk about <i>Elastic</i> vs <i>Plastic</i> behaviors in a material  </span></a></h5>	
					Elasticity is not just about materials we normally think of as "stretchy". Elasticity also refers to how materials recover even when we can't see the deformities that happen under load. For example, when the Golden Gate Bridge is occupied by bumper-to-bumper traffic, there is an imperceptible (to us) deformity in the deck of the bridge caused by the weight of the cars. If all the cars then leave the bridge, the bridge will recover (thankfully, it is a well-designed bridge and does not collapse under heavy traffic). Even though we can't see that the bridge is being somewhat compressed under the load, it does happen.
					<p><p>Elastic behavior is where a material under strain recovers to its original configuration after the load is removed. Plastic behavior is where the material retains its deformed shape (think of pounding silly putty with your hand into a flat shape - it will stay flat, demonstrating "plastic" behavior). We normally think of a rubber band being "elastic", but this elasticity is not the material <i>property</i>, it is the <i>behavior</i> of the rubber band where it snaps back to its original shape after the load is removed. If you stretch the rubber band beyond its ability to snap back, it will break - demonstrating plastic behavior.  

					<p><p>Going back to the Golden Gate Bridge example: In 1987, for the bridge's <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_20695952/day-golden-gate-bridge-flattened" target="_blank">50th anniversary</a>, the bridge was closed to vehicle traffic and pedestrians swarmed the bridge for the celebration. An estimated 300,000 people were on the bridge for the celebration. A bridge full of people weighs more than a bridge full of cars (an estimated 5400 lbs per square foot, about double the weight of a full load of cars). The bridge was designed expecting a maximum of 5700 lbs per square foot - but as is usual practice, it was over-engineered to be able to handle much more than that. During the event, the bridge was visibly sagging by around 7 feet. The bridge did not break, and after the festival returned to its normal shape - thus demonstrating the principle of elasticity in a set of materials we don't normally think of as "elastic". The load that day was within the elastic part of what the bridge could handle; something else entirely might happen if an asteroid dropped on the bridge.<p><p>
					<h5><a id="Mats8"><span class="sectionheader">Another material property of interest is <i>Electrical Conductivity</i></span></a></h5>	
					Electrical conductivity is a property that refers to the degree to which a material will conduct electricity. Copper is highly conductive, which is why it is used for wiring. Rubber is not, which is why, if you have to be out in a lightning storm, or you're planning to touch exposed electrical wires (neither of which we recommend), you might be marginally safer in rubber-soled shoes. A material which is semi-conducting, like silicon, will allow current to flow, but less so than copper. The fact that it is a <i>semi</i>conducting material is what enables it to be used in electronics, as the flow can be controlled to allow current or not, enabling a whole digital world.<p><p>
			
					<h5><a id="Mats9"><span class="sectionheader">Engineers select materials based on the intended use of the structure to be built, and the inherent properties of the materials</i></span></a></h5>
				We started by talking about how different materials have different properties, and how you would choose materials for a thing (object or structure) based on the identified use of the structure, and the materials needed to support that use. That leads us nicely to the section on structures - link here. Meanwhile, if you are curious about other materials properties, you can look up properties of materials on <a href="http://www.matweb.com" target="_blank">MatWeb</a>. This is a very comprehensive site, and goes way beyond the concepts here - but it is interesting to browse through. For example, if you search for "steel", a large number of results will be returned for various types of steel, from Low Carbon Steel, to Stainless Steel, to Water Hardening Steel - 50 different types of steel at current note - and you can find out more about each one of these.
